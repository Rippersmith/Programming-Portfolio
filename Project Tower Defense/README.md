For Northeastern University, I was almost exclusively the solo developer on the project, adding new assets & mechanics into the game based oin what the designers wanted. It utilized VR/XR controls, the Oculus Pro's eye-tracking, communication with an LSL-based balance board to control rotation in game & record players' balance, and utlizing a Job system to monitor the enemy's movement and AI.
